**Project Summary: Translating Data Insights into Actionable Business Strategy**

Credit One Bank captures numerous data attributes from credit card applicants. This exercise is designed to test your end-to-end data science capabilities: your technical ability to uncover meaningful patterns within this data and your skill in translating these findings into a persuasive business recommendation.

**Project Deliverables:**
- Persuasive Business Case: A 1–3-page PowerPoint deck or Word document outlining your data-driven recommendations and anticipated business value.
- Analytical Code: All supporting code (Python, SAS, R, SQL).

**Dataset Summary:**

The data comprises a sample of approved applications, all attributes reflect the status of that applicant at the time of application. The goal is to minimize "delinquent_account" and optimize "active_account" using as simple a strategy as possible.
