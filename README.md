**Project Summary: Translating Data Insights into Actionable Business Strategy**

Credit One Bank captures numerous data attributes from credit card applicants. This exercise is designed to test your end-to-end data science capabilities: your technical ability to uncover meaningful patterns within this data and your skill in translating these findings into a persuasive business recommendation.

**Project Deliverables:**
- Persuasive Business Case: A 1–3-page PowerPoint deck or Word document outlining your data-driven recommendations and anticipated business value.
- Analytical Code: All supporting code (Python, SAS, R, SQL).

**Dataset Summary:**

The data comprises a sample of approved applications, all attributes reflect the status of that applicant at the time of application. The goal is to minimize "delinquent_account" and optimize "active_account" using as simple a strategy as possible.

### Deliverable Summary

1. main.py -> Primary Code
2. run_me.ipynb -> Runs the code, produces the feature selection report and also produces the recommendation list.
3. REPORT.md -> A markdown report that describes how the requirements were met.
4. report.docx -> A docx version of the markdown report.
5. report.pptx -> A powerpoint presentation of the report.

# Questions

- why choose lightgb instead of a different model? What other options are there?
- I used grid search to choose hyperparameters, what other kinds of hyperparameter search exists?
- What are some caveats to the methodology I used here?
- How long has feature selection been used in real world applications?
